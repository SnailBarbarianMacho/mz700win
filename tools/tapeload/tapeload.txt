tapeload.exe ver 0.14 Copyright (c) 1999-2000,2009 Takeshi Maruyama

Based on Russel Marks's mzget - read MZ700 tape data
outputs header to `header.dat', and data to `out.dat'.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------
Sound Card (ex. SoundBlaster-16)
32 Megabytes of memory


Software Requirements
---------------------
Windows XP/Vista (32bit)

What is this?
-------------
This program loads the tape of MZ700/800 from the WAV file recorded by
22050Hz monophonic recording, or a sound card.


How to use
----------
This program is running in a DOS box under Windows.

usage:tapeload [options] <Wavefile[.wav]>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When there is no specification of a file name, it loads from a LINE-IN jack.
To use it, you must have a sound card with sampling abilities
(ex. SoundBlaster16), a tape with MZ files and a cassette player.

First, connect the MIC jack of the sound card to the OUT jack of
the cassette player with an audio cable, then insert a tape into
the player.

Next, in the DOS box, execute "tapeload.exe".
It will print "Now Searching...."
You can cancel anytime by pressing the [Esc] key.

Next, push the play button on the cassette player.

Next, wait a moment.
It will print "done gapck", "done tmark" and "FOUND filename".

Next, when the file is loaded, it will print "ok!".
MZ data files are created in your current directory.
"header.dat" is the header of the MZ data. It includes the file name
and address information. Its size is 128 bytes.

"out.dat" is the actual MZ data in raw format.

To use these files on mz700win, enter the following at the DOS prompt:
copy /b header.dat+out.dat filename.mzt [ENTER]

filename.mzt is executable by mz700win.


Running S-BASIC
---------------
In old version of MZ700WIN, the *.mzt (or *.m12, These are same format) files
could't load on S-BASIC. Because in order to implement load emulation, 
MZ700WIN patches ROM-Monitor program.
While running S-BASIC, Memory address $0000-$0FFF is not Monitor-ROM.
It is RAM. Patched load-routine is not used. Therefore the *.mzt files couldn't
be loaded on S-BASIC.

Now, You can load the program files of S-BASIC.
Patch your *.mzt file of S-BASIC.

00000040: 50 41 54 3A 21 12 0C ED F4 03 ED F4 04 ED F4 01 
00000050: ED F4 02 FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 

When you use this patched file, You can load the program files on S-BASIC.


----
Supposing WAV file name was specified, tapeload will perform reading from
the WAV file. 
It must be recorded by 22050Hz monophonic 8bit PCM.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

----
If you don't succeed, try these options.

ex.)tapeload -r -d16

    -l[e|j]The main messages are outputted in
           English (e) / Japanese (j)
    -mN    Set wave buffer size to N megabytes (default:N=16/range:1-32)
    -r     The phase of voice data is reversed.
    -dN    Adjust input level (default:N=32/range:1-127)
    -wN    Data reading unit time (default:N=7/range:1-16)

    -b     Display bit data
    -v     Display read code
