mz700win by Takeshi Maruyama, based on Russell Marks's 'mz700em'.
MZ700 emulator 'mz700em' for VGA PCs running Linux (C) 1996 Russell Marks.

In Primary version, I ported Linux version to Win32 directly. But it was slow.
This version of MZ700WIN was rewritten newly by me.

You have regrettable information. I must decide the MZ700WIN project will

If you have a 'MZ700.ROM', You must move ROM images into the folder named
'ROMS' and rename your 'MZ700.ROM' to '1Z013.ROM'.

'1Z013.ROM' is the image file of ROM-Monitor of MZ700. In order to use
MZ700 emulator, You must have *REAL* MZ700 machine. And you must dump
ROM Images by yourself.

Do you have *REAL* MZ700 machine?

If you have a MZ700 machine, Save memory area 0000h-0FFFh to cassete tape,
And use 'tapeload.exe'. (It was included in the archive of MZ700WIN) 

If succeed, The file named 'out.dat' is created.
Its size is 4096 bytes. Please rename it 'out.dat' to '1Z013.ROM'.


You can work the MZ700WIN emulator with the MZ800 rom.
But to work it, You need to patch your MZ800 rom.

Patch MZ800 ROM with the binary editor:

0001 : 00 -> 4A
0002 : E8 -> 00



* CG-ROM             MZ700FON.DAT or MZ700FON.JP (4096bytes)

'MZ700FON.DAT' is the image file of Character-ROM.
In order to get it, You can use the tool called 'mkfnt.exe' and
Its data file.

This data file 'MZ700FON.JP' is the character font data. This is not from
the MZ700, but put together by hand.
It is Japanese font file.
